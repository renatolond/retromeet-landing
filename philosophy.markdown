We believe online dating is a thing and won't go away anytime soon. However, we also think there are problems with online dating nowadays: since the main apps are looking for profit, they are interested in keeping people on a loop of coming back to the app, making people spend energy on dates that might not go anywhere and on repeated conversations.

This causes a kind of {% external_link {"text": "dating", "link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240910111533/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/18/dating-burnout-meet-the-people-who-ditched-the-apps-and-found-love-offline"} %} {% external_link {"text": "burnout", "link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240910111537/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/well/mind/burnout-online-dating-apps.html"} %}, which seems to be showing indications that the way dating apps currently are is bad for mental health.

On top of that, time and time again apps have been found to have some questionable privacy practices, {% external_link {"text": "leaking location data", "link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20240428023928/https://www.engadget.com/grindr-location-data-sold-for-years-145320411.html"} %}, either intentionally for selling the data or unintentionally by means of data leaks.

We think that online dating can be better and more accommodating of different profiles of people, so RetroMeet adheres to the following ideas:
- Try to cater to people looking for different things: people looking for life partnerships, polyamorous relationships, casual sex, etc.
- Avoid any kind of gamification of the whole dating experience: no notifications trying to say you are losing chances, no countdown to be able to look at other profiles.
- Make algorithms as clear as possible and let people choose if they want to use them or not.
- Be as privacy-aware as possible, providing multiple levels of disclosure for other network participants.

We believe that by holding those values in our minds while developing RetroMeet we can make a dating app that is better for everyone involved.
